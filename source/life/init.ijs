NB. life rules
NB. For a space that is occupied:
NB.     Each cell with one or no neighbors dies
NB.     Each cell with four or more neighbors dies
NB.     Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
NB. For a space that is empty:
NB.     Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
NB.
NB. Each step is computed as follows:
NB.
NB. STATE=: TRANS {~ #. INDEX { STATE
NB.
NB. Suppose n is the number of cells in the board.
NB. STATE is the ravelled board, a boolean of length n with 1=alive.
NB. INDEX is a n x 9 table of indices that gives the 9 surrounding cells for each cell.
NB. TRANS is a list of length 512=2^9, that gives the new life state for each old value.
